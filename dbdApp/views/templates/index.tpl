	<h3>{$title}</h3>
	<p>
		dbdMVC is a ridiculously simple, yet powerful, PHP framework that suggests a realistic approach to developing amazing web software.
		It implements the, now standard, model view controller design pattern. In addition dbdMVC has implemented some features from
		the best frameworks currently on the market, yet poignantly left out the fluff that is not needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have also implemented our view layer with the commonly used template engine, <a href="http://www.smarty.net" title="Smarty Template Engine">Smarty</a>.
		Wait, it gets better... Did we mention that it also implements a custom subset of CSS to allow for variables, simple math equations,
		server side imports &amp; minification, as well as a robust button generating engine that outputs super fast downloading sprites.
		Yep, it does all that too!
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are tired of wasting time with the details of parsing requests, optimizing sources (XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript), writing SQL,
		and rewriting solid application logic... then save yourself another headache and download dbdMVC. You'll be so glad you did!
